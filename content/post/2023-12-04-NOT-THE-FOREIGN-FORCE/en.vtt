00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.070
We demand freedom! 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.550
We demand freedom! We demand freedom!

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.570
The situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan...

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.650
Eight individuals who spread rumors 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.790
were lawfully investigated and punished.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.990
The entrances weren't bound with wire in that residential community.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.310
Some residents are weak in self-defense and self-rescue.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.560
The fire trucks aren't able to enter.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.680
Dignity! Dignity! We demand dignity!

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.440
We demand dignity!

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.280
We demand the truth.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.490
Stop Zero-COVID policy!

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.340
A single spark can start a prairie fire.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450
So, why do you block the road?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.770
Asshole, Xi Jinping!

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.800
CCP step down! CCP step down!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.090
Are we people meant to be oppressed, aren't we?

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.930
Have I committed a crime by holding a flower?

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.470
Release them! Release them!

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.720
Keep walking. I'm telling you to keep walking, do you understand?

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.980
We are all family.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.870
Release them then.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.000
We demand human rights!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.120
On Nov. 20, 2022,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.580
the world welcomed the 22nd FIFA World Cup.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.950
While football fans all over the world were focusing on Qatar,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.240
a protest was going on at Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou, China.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.620
Due to discrepancies in the agreed-upon wages,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.960
and the strict pandemic lockdown controls,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.620
The personal freedom and life safety of Foxconn workers 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.220
weren't being guaranteed.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.200
Those individuals at the bottom of the society

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.830
were compelled to resist the power of capital and government authority.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.050
The police are beating people!

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.750
The police are beating people!

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.950
On the other hand, 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.020
it's not easy for the majority of ordinary people in China.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.070
Over the past three years, 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.620
the government mandatorily implemented the "zero-COVID" policy,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.300
had plunged the entire nation into fear and violence.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.020
You'd better not beat. I've got you on video.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.200
What are you doing with the guns?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.570
Point at your own people?

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.900
Chinese citizens here.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.100
Point at civilians?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.700
Whom are you pointing your gun at?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.870
All people will be locked down, not only you in No. 3.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.330
People were confined to their homes,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.290
neighborhoods are sealed off,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.020
with iron gates welded shut,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.050
and they were compelled to purchase overpriced groceries.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.260
And the daily PCR Tests.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.980
If the result was positive,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.100
the whole family, or residents of the entire building

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.290
would all be forcibly transferred to isolation cabins.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.670
Go! Go!

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.750
Are you against CCP?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.900
The police are beating people!

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.120
It even hasn't had the bed set up yet (in the isolation cabin), 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.370
so, people can only sleep on the floor.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.640
You'll be penalized.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.290
that will affect three generations of your family.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.560
This will be our last generation. Thank you.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.480
But on Chinese internet, 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.020
All you can see is the official sugarcoating of the pandemic control.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.250
The information, including Foxconn protests,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.830
all critiques of government pandemic policies are blocked. 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.970
Even if someone manages to post such content online, 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.970
it would also be immediately blocked.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.580
the accounts would be banned, leaving blank pages.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.950
The CCP's longstanding information control policy,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.670
had reached its peak during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.260
From picture, texts, to videos,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.390
censorship was around almost every corner.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.950
However, a few transient information about Foxconn in Henan,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.760
had given a lot of people an insight into 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.790
what the Chinese people at the bottom were going through.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.210
Ordinary Chinese, through the lens of the World Cup broadcast

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.440
also began to question the rationality of the national pandemic policy.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.140
In the stadium of the Qatar World Cup,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.060
there's not a single fan wearing a mask.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.730
No PCR kiosks,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.200
no isolation cabins,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.120
and no white PPE suits.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.970
The sentiment of questioning and resistance spread rapidly.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.670
Messi has had COVID-19, and C. Ronaldo has had COVID-19.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.720
The World Cup now brings together all the richest people in the world,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.270
and they are not afraid of succumbing to COVID-19.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.640
You confine us the lowest and poorest people here.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.650
Now you're telling us it's good for us?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.260
Don't use violence!

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.300
The subsequent fire

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.520
really ignited the anger in people.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.000
On Nov. 24,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.860
in the city of Urumqi, Xinjiang, 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.520
where had been locked down for more than 100 days.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.470
A serious fire occurred in a high-rise building.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.870
The fire's not out yet.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.830
The house next door to it, the house above it, 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.470
they're all on fire right now.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.380
The fire spread from the 15th to the 17th floor.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.560
And smoke spread to the 21st floor.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.520
Official reports stated 19 casualties.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.510
It took about 3 hours to put out the fire.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.420
The gate is too small for the fire trucks to get in.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.860
There are already 4 fire trucks here,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.060
but none of them can get in.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.780
The fire is getting bigger now.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.230
The cause of the fire was suspected to be a power strip fire.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.600
But due to the city-wide pandemic control,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.780
the neighborhood and corridors were sealed off.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.730
Did this hinder the entry of fire trucks and evacuation of residents?

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.090
This raised intense discussions on the Chinese internet.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.650
Please, 16th floor.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.150
16th floor. We're already short of oxygen.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.010
Our kids are dying, too.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.940
We're too short of oxygen right now.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.670
Everyone, look at this. 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.260
This is Unit 3, it's also bound with iron wire.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.970
I opened the door from Unit 4, then I came here.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.370
We escaped to Unit 3 and it has been locked.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.940
We can't get through it.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.620
Take a good look at it.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.770
The unit doors, the fire fighting access, are all bound with iron wire.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.030
It's said that due to the pandemic control, no passing through.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.540
No one opened the door.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.160
Firefighters sprayed water from the entrance of the neighborhood.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.450
Am I not allowed to say anything?

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.590
I'm telling the truth, you're fxxking warning. Fxxk you.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.170
Yet, at the official press conference

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.200
The spokesperson vehemently denied of any locked or welded doors.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.660
Instead, he attributed the tragedy to

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.320
the weak abilities of self-rescue of the residents.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.670
The entrances weren't bound with wire in that residential community.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.150
(The evidence) was a malicious splicing.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.550
In the neighborhood that was on fire, the roads are narrow,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.220
private cars were parked chaotically,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.670
prevented the fire trucks from responding rapidly.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.900
Some residents are weak in self-defense and self-rescue,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.340
unfamiliar with the location of the 2rd safe exit,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.380
which leads to the roof of the building,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.220
failed to fight the fire effectively when it occurred,

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.150
and failed to get out in time.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.500
The press conference sparked nationwide anger.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.720
Various unreasonable measures during the pandemic lockdown,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.800
were glaringly highlighted in the tragic Urumqi fire incident.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.830
And when disaster struck,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.890
the government decision-makers 

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.550
manage to absolve themselves of all the responsibilities,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.450
and leaving the victims to bear all the consequences.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.700
This has provoked anger all over the internet,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.630
as anyone could potentially be 

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.650
one of the victims burned in the Urumqi fire.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.590
What happened in Urumqi, can also happen in every corner of China.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.080
Behind the internet,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.350
are those ordinary people, who had been under pandemic for so long,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.450
their rights had been continually sacrificed,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.010
they were full of grievances, yet no outlet to express.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.250
Powerlessness, silence, and obedience, 

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.270
were the microcosm of the darkside of this period.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.880
No filming, no filming.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.490
And the final straw that broke the camel's back,

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.310
was the incident that happened on Nov. 25th,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.270
The widespread online video showed,

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:49.560
in Lianxin Community, Reg. 104, Div. 12, Xinjiang Urumqi Corps,

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.190
the incidents of assault of residents by staff members.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.550
What do you think you are?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.970
I'm asking, what do you think you are?

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.700
Didn't I tell you that at the beginning?

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.430
Not mentioned.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.560
You swear when you get up here.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.390
What did I tell you?

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.000
The community quickly rallied together

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.560
stormed the Public Security Bureau and the CCP Office,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.410
demanding that the assailant be handed over.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.710
Did you assault?

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.900
Hand over the assailant!

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.110
Lift the lockdown!

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.780
They're fighting! They're fighting!

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.200
The protest lasted from daytime until late at night,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.890
without receiving any official reply,

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.050
and suppressed by the government.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:03.260
But it rapidly spread from the Lianxin to other parts of Urumqi.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.850
People lifted the blockade in their residential areas on their own.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.490
and marched together towards the city government building.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:18.730
Lift the lockdown! Lift the lockdown!

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.250
The people's police should serve the people,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.310
but you're not serving, you're suppressing.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.700
Whose children are you? And whose father are you?

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.180
Don't you have a conscience?

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:29.520
How many people died today?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.170
Don't you have a conscience?

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.370
Do you even have a conscience?

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.320
If we'll die, you die with us!

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.880
Is Covid a thing?

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.660
We demand the complete lifting of the lockdown tomorrow!

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.190
Lift the lockdown! Lift the lockdown!

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.310
Lift the lockdown! Lift the lockdown!

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.870
All forcefully expend their last cries.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.170
Unable to quell public discontent,

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.570
the CPP government finally chose to give in,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.790
and announced the lifting of the lockdown in Urumqi.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.720
Brave the enemy's gunfire, March on!

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.030
Low-risk neighborhoods, will lift the lockdown tomorrow.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.190
You shouldn't enforce the law violently.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:28.350
As public servants, you have lost even the minimum of professionalism

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.540
It's even darker than the people.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:37.270
Does it count as legitimate gangsters with authority?

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.810
The protest lasted from Nov. 25 to 26, 

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:47.050
Chinese media made strong efforts to block news related to Urumqi. 

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.800
Urumqi became a forbidden term on the internet, 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.010
Any accounts discussing the Urumqi fires or the Xinjiang lockdown

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.840
were banned.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.720
The government had controlled the hottest topics on social media,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.320
arranged with celebrity gossip and World Cup-related news,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.470
in an attempt to divert attention.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.200
But the more the government bans,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.100
the more people utilize their creativity and imagination

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.420
All over China's universities and cities,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.870
graffiti, posters, and flyers were popping up,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.460
expressing solidarity with Urumqi.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.450
The protests in Urumqi had broken the silence, 

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.290
prompting people nationwide to follow suit.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.270
On Nov. 26, 

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.150
students from the Communication University of Nanjing 

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.320
held up white papers

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.980
to protest against the government's online censorship

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.930
 to cover up the truth.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.470
Long live the people!

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.450
I speak out for those who lost loved ones, families and friends, in the fire,

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.350
I also speak out for all those who perished across the country.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.510
Single sparks, began to spread across the land of China.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.210
it finally coalesced into a nationwide mass protest, on Nov. 26.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.350
Lift the lockdown!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.060
Deepest condolences to the compatriots died in the fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.020
However, on Nov. 26, in Shanghai 

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.800
it seemed to be in a state of calm. 

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.820
It was Saturday, 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.630
with the opportunity of World Cup, 

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.850
young people, elegantly dressed, lingered between bars,

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.630
a scene that starkly contrasted with the protests happening elsewhere.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.190
The experience of the lockdown in Shanghai from March to June in 2022

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.060
hasn't been forgotten,

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.570
 and the entire city was still recovering from the pain and wounds.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.760
It made people in Shanghai more capable of empathizing

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.110
 with people in other cities under lockdown.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.340
Soon, a few photos broke the tranquility in Shanghai.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.500
Some young people spontaneously gathered

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.650
 on Urumqi Middle Road in Shanghai,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:31.850
offered flowers and candles to the victims of the Urumqi fire on Nov. 24,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.610
to mourn those who perished in the fire.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.950
These photos of Urumqi Middle Road

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.570
stirred people's memories of the lockdown in Shanghai.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.640
As the photos were quickly circulated on social media in Shanghai,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.350
Close to the start of the World Cup, 

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.950
many young people spontaneously left the bars 

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.870
Ordinary people who were watching TV at home, got dressed and went out.

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.250
and headed to Urumqi Middle Road.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.320
People were holding this sentiment towards their compatriots,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.590
which was also a silent resistance against injustice.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.630
This may be the only thing we can do for the lives that have perished.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.790
Without prior arrangement or schedule,

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.870
the initial group heading to mourn,

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.880
gathered in the middle of Urumqi Middle Road and Anfu Road.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.320
The candles on the scene were mostly aromatic candles.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.630
brought hurriedly by people from their homes.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.670
In silence, people remain unspoken,

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.490
sorrow subtly revealed in the tranquility.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.930
Candlelight flickers on a winter's night,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.620
illuminating countenances tinged with sorrow.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.220
At midnight on Nov. 27, 

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.050
the police arrived,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.810
 and engaged with those participating in the mourning, 

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.970
eager to find out who had organized this event,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.860
and who brought people here?

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.440
I'd like to ask, who brought this placard? 

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.400
We brought it all together.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.900
- Who brought it?    - We brought it together.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.550
All of us brought it.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.190
All of us. All of us.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.270
Everyone, don't worry, 

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.420
we don't mean that who brought this placard here is guilty. 

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.000
We're just investigating. 

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.030
Who said it? Who said the spot?

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.240
Who said it?

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.010
I promise, okay?

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.350
What the hell can you promise? Who are you?

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.900
Why are you arresting people?

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.630
Right here, right here.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.120
Let me talk to him alone, okay?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.020
It's okay. Just trust it.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.470
Speak loudly.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:53.500
No problem, okey?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.090
Why do you arrest him? No!

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.860
Speak loudly.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.750
Answer loudly.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.250
Let's take a brief look at the situation.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.820
If you want to talk alone, can you show me the papers?

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.270
I just inquire about the situation.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.250
You and me talk for a few minutes alone, okey?

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.310
No problem, no problem.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.850
You speak loudly.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.720
Law enforcement should always be fair and impartial.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.710
Everyone, calm down.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.670
Everyone, calm down, we're here with him.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.630
We're all law-abiding citizens.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.320
We hope you can keep in order here,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.890
all right?

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.640
The government doesn't believe that people gathered here voluntarily. 

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.850
The aggressiveness of the police 

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.680
had also sparked resentment among the people.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.140
Speak out！

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.340
I just came over after a drink.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.700
It seemed to be something about the fire.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.100
May I ask if you brought the placard?

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.910
I didn't make that.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.490
So why are you here?

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.260
Since I saw this, I wanted...

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.180
I didn't do anything. I had nothing to do with this.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.550
I'm just trying to figure out the situation, 

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.950
I'm not saying you did it. I'm just trying to figure out the situation.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.520
I want to know, who's responsible here? 

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.910
- I want to know, what's going on here today?    - I don't know.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.760
I'm just asking, don't be nervous. 

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.330
I'm just asking, okey?

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.400
So, are you done?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.150
I have no bad intentions.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.820
No bad intentions.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.370
Who knows? Who organized this event?

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.170
We organized it together, voluntarily, do you understand?

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.120
Who organized it? Speak up! All speak up!

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.380
I did. I did. I did.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.240
Due to insufficient police presence, 

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.670
to prevent more people from participating in the rally,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:38.970
Police began to cordon off the Changle and Anfu roads,

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.070
while blocking the entry of crowds, 

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.100
they also surrounded the protestors on Urumqi Middle Road.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.790
The arbitrary road closure fueled resentment among those passing by, 

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.100
Those who wanted to go home, had to take the long way around.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.070
People had disputes with the police.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.350
Let me through.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.770
Why can't you go over there?

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:00.760
Please cooperate with us.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.010
Why should I cooperate with you?

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.020
Why do you want me to cooperate? Let me pass!

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.550
I'm going this way. My home is that way.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.720
It's this way. Why can't I pass?

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.710
If your home is this way, please make your own detour, 

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.790
and if it's inconvenient for you...

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.600
You tell me which way to go. You show me the way.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.340
You show me the way, where I should go.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.410
If you don't want to take a detour, you can wait here.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.670
I don't want to wait. I want to go this way now.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.710
You tell me why I can't go this way.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.970
You didn't have any reason. You just told me no.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.100
Thank you for your cooperation. Please cooperate.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.010
I want to cooperate, but you have to give me a convincing reason.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.750
Why should I cooperate with you?

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.810
Ma'am, thank you for your cooperation, and again...

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.200
But you have to tell me exactly why it's closed.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.400
Why can't I pass?

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.430
for what reason?

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.860
You tell me why.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.430
This stretch of road is unsafe.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.850
I don't need you to keep me safe. I don't need it.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.700
Step back, please.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.950
I don't feel like you are keeping me safe.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.830
I want the freedom to pass this way, okay?

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.650
Why do you close the road?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.280
Why do you close the road?

00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.830
I live here, and I want to go home.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.970
You block the road, and ask me to walk around.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.070
I'm exhausted to walk anymore.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.240
The disputes at the Changle Road and Urumqi Road intersection 

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.080
attracted many onlookers. 

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.090
A pregnant woman, after arguing with the police for going home, 

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.060
was reluctantly allowed to pass.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.610
Can't we even mourn our deceased compatriots?

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.190
We can mourn here, too. Are you gonna form the cordon behind us?

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.900
Why don't you just form cordons all around the Bund?

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.020
Around the whole city of Shanghai?

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.350
Now pretending to be deaf.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.020
You police are taking us taxpayers' money, and blocking our way here?

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.380
Do you even have a reason to block the road?

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.670
What official document allows you to block the road? 

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.070
What's the exact rule?

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.960
Is the road closed for the Shanghai Marathon or something?

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.320
Make up a reason now.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.200
Ask your own heart! 

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.450
Are you the people's police, 

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.220
or are you just appointed police?

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.000
 Who appointed you? 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.700
Good point!

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.960
What are you afraid of?

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.040
Speak out, what are you afraid of?

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.970
A girl from Xinjiang expressed that,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.120
she wanted to send a bouquet of flowers to the victims,

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.860
was ridiculed by the police

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.760
The attitude of the police sparked the outrage of people.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.060
Why is it your call?

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.480
Don't be ridiculous.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.090
What do you mean, don't be ridiculous?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.350
Is this a joke?

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.010
Your family is dead.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.420
Your compatriots are dead.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.480
In waves of questioning, 

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.780
the conflict between the police and the masses escalated.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:38.520
You're a human being, aren't you?

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.640
and eventually, people broke through the blockade on Changle Road,

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.670
made a forcible entry.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.280
But no one felt the joy of victory

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:48.410
Everyone knew that they had only won 

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.590
the freedom that originally belonged to them.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.430
Do you have the right to close the road?

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.620
We just want to mourn for our compatriots. 

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.790
What's wrong with that?

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.690
We're all at the bottom. 

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.870
Can we think about each other for a bit, and stop hurting each other?

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.680
A participant attempted to ease tensions,

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.550
by expressing the wish to hug a police officer,

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.220
but was ignored and refused.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.800
Can I shake your hand?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.630
You can. I've already shaken it.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:19.600
Can't I even shake your hands? 

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.990
Can I have a hug?

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.470
We're human beings in the first place.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.000
We are a family. Hugs. Why can't we hug?

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:27.900
Can I give you a hug?

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.370
The other participants hugged him,

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.640
in contrast to the indifference of law enforcement.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:33.880
Thank you.

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:35.750
Can we have a hug?

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:36.980
Can I shake your hand?

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.090
Thank you!

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.520
Why aren't they afraid of me?

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:44.490
Why didn't they turn me down?

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.550
Because he is afraid of taking responsibility.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.770
Oh, God. Who is responsible?

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.800
Who gave you that responsibility?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.600
Can I have a hug?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.720
I'd like to ask for a hug.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.740
The people's police should embrace the people

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:01.450
Shall we hug?

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.720
Thank you!

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.530
Thank you. Thank you.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.000
Can I shed tears?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.820
Thank you. Thank you.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.570
Are people not allowed to shed tears?

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.600
Thank you.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.580
Human, human.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.000
Being a human first.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.830
Isn't it tears that separate people from each other?

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.320
Are you able to shed tears? 

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.350
Do you know how ridiculous you are?

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.920
People are ends, not means.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.700
How much does this job pay?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.970
Can't you just raise the muzzle an inch?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.170
We shouldn't be in opposition.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.230
We are the people, and you are the people's police.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.040
Do you serve the people?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.570
Have you ever considered that the next oppressed could be you?

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.860
People first, life first

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.520
How would you think if your family died in the Urumqi fire?

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.770
If we're locked down one day, and we've no supplies,

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.400
 and are we supposed to starve to death?

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.980
Have you been through the two-month lockdown in Shanghai?

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.200
They were not quarantined.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.400
They've never been deprived of their freedom,

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.380
they are here to suppress the people.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.050
Can we shed tears?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.790
We're going to shed tears.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.230
We'll shed all the tears we want. It's none of your business.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.050
More and more people entered Urumqi Middle Road.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.560
Those who arrived at the center of the gathering fell silent.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.100
They looked at the candles and flowers in front of them.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.540
And in the cold wind, someone was sobbing.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.400
People began raising white papers,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.050
blank papers, silently protesting

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.060
the injustices and grievances suffered over the past 3 years.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.350
On the other side of the blockade on Anfu Road, 

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.910
conflict also broke out between people and the police.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.050
Serve the People!

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.290
Serve the People!

00:26:58.290 --> 00:26:59.640
I'd like to ask a question.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.550
Speak with authority, huh!

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:05.560
You said don't give me that. What's that? What?

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.790
Don't be a Changgui.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.310
The tough police officers ordered the crowd to obey, 

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.330
which had made people more united instead.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.220
What do you think we're doing?

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.270
Absence of legal prohibition means freedom.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.820
Be a human.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.520
When the police questioned 

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.590
whether there were people from Xinjiang present,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.470
 the response from the crowd was, 

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.150
"We are all from Xinjiang."

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.240
Anyone from Xinjiang?

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.780
We're all from Xinjiang.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:48.000
NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.320
More and more people held up white papers,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.150
shouting out: NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.270
venting about what used to be blocked daily on the internet.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.780
making their position clear to the police, who symbolized centralized power.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.240
Eventually, the police gave in to the unity of the people.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.420
Everybody's happy and cheering: There's no cordons anymore.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.320
There's no cordons anymore.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.530
At this moment, the number of participants had reached its peak.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:46.100
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.690
Thank you.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:55.920
Thank you.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.770
Thank you.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.720
Can we take off our masks?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.720
Some people took off the masks, breathing the free air briefly. 

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.860
NO to masks, YES to freedom!

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.650
Some silently held up white sheets of paper, 

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.340
which spoke louder than words.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.130
The police hadn't been idle either.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:22.330
After a group of people entered Urumqi Middle Road,

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.730
they re-formed the cordon soon.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.920
A foreigner was refused to enter by the police.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.600
In response to their "loyalty",

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.280
he threw a few coins at them as a sarcastic "reward".

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.890
I didn't go out.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.140
Don't step on the line, okay? I'm asking you to step aside now, okay?

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.770
Don't start a conflict, okay?

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.600
Don't start a conflict.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.190
The formalistic behaviors of the police only fuel people's anger. 

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.240
Each time when the cordon was raised, 

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.320
individuals would confront the police, arguing for their rights.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.550
What if someone is tripped over, by this line?

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.820
A pregnant woman kept questioning why there was the cordon.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.570
What if a pregnant woman steps on and falls?

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.950
You can't just close the road arbitrarily.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.590
Police had been dodging questions from people.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.710
We demand a reason to close the road. Is that so hard?

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.470
Let's just say we can stand here, can't we?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.800
Police don't break the law.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.400
You have to guard the law, don't break it.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.590
First of all, there are too many people here.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.910
If a stampede occurs, it's not responsible for your safety.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.580
Are you afraid of a fire?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.020
Are you afraid of a fire? I'm familiar with that.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.190
Stay strong, Xinjiang!

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:55.770
Stay strong, Xinjiang! 

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:58.930
Stay strong, Shanghai!

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.360
Your presence here will only make more and more people here.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.030
When you're gone, everyone's gone.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.680
Without this cordon, nothing will happen.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.960
But without this cordon...

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.950
This cordon has put you and us on opposite sides.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.960
We shouldn't be on opposite sides.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.240
What makes Shanghai Shanghai, is without this cordon.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.660
That's why Shanghai is Shanghai.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.730
The truth is, if you're gone, we're gone.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.570
But maybe your leader said that 

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.080
you can't dismiss until everyone's gone, right?

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.140
Who doesn't have a few stupid leaders?

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.610
Good point.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.240
And the leader's leader.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.100
Did you get your bonus for next month?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.650
There will be a bonus at the end of the year.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.520
We all know that your mission today is stupid.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.960
- We know it's not easy for you.    - We know, yeah.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.900
Be careful.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.230
Don't play with your body safety, okay?

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.650
You guys shouldn't put such dangerous things here,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.400
then you don't have to think about my safety.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.240
Stay strong, Xinjiang!

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.640
Stay strong, Xinjiang!

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.000
We're all human.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.890
That's right.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.090
We're all Chinese. We're all Chinese.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.340
We're the same. We all live here.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.040
We love others, and we love you.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.860
If you remove the cordon and drive the car away, people will disperse.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.140
Bye, bye.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.150
In the seesaw battle, 

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.030
the police had been wearing down the energy of the people on-site,

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.560
meanwhile, called for more police reinforcements.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.930
Some plainclothes police officers hidden in the crowd,

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:55.330
pretend to be pedestrians,

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.890
and took photos of the protesters without masks.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.370
Why is the cordon formed again over there?

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.890
Why is it pulled up again? It doesn't work.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.980
On both sides of Changle Road and Anfu Road,

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.250
crowds and police continued to dispute and fight.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:24.570
When the beating of your heart, Echoes the beating of the drums.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:28.550
There is a life about to start, When tomorrow comes.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:30.580
Everyone sang loudly, 

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.370
to relieve their stress,

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.240
and to push back against the police.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.550
Millions of hearts together, Brave the enemies' gunfire! March on!

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.380
More police officers arrived one after another. 

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.090
The police were getting stronger and tougher.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.020
They formed tightly-packed human walls, 

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.000
starting to encircle and contract towards the Urumqi Middle Road.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.910
And many mourners came and went.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.230
Some had fought it, some were just passing through.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.350
As one diminishes, another grows.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.770
The confrontation between those who remained and the police,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.320
became more intense and dangerous.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.100
At the intersection of Anfu Road and Urumqi Middle Road,

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.290
flowers and candles were placed, too.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:19.710
It's the front line of the confrontation with the police.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.410
They bravely cried out: 

00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:24.960
"We demand dignity!"

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.310
At this very moment, someone shouted out the most forbidden slogan,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:31.150
which opened the curtain on the protest for the night.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.360
Asshole, Xi Jinping!

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.630
Asshole, Xi Jinping!

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.830
Abolish the PCR tests!

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.900
From tomorrow on, no more PCR tests!

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:12.890
Take off the masks, no more PCR tests!

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.530
At 2:00 AM on Nov. 27, 

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.500
the remaining people gathered at the Anfu intersection.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:21.170
Facing the human wall of the police,

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.060
people were holding up white papers and venting their anger.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.960
NO to PCR tests! NO to PCR tests!

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:46.460
NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.280
NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:59.730
Give me liberty, or give me death!

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:14.040
Give me liberty, or give me death!

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.000
Take off the masks.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.380
Abolish the PCR tests!

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.500
Compensate for my three years.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:22.920
Abolish the PCR tests!

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.030
To the anti-epidemic policies over the past 3 years,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.000
people expressed their dissent.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.900
It had been so much for so long.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.100
Lift the lockdown!

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.380
Lift the lockdown!

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.410
Lift the lockdown!

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:47.360
Lift the lockdown!

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:59.290
Abolish the Health Code!

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:04.500
Abolish the Health Code!

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:10.090
I'm very healthy, I don't need the Health Code.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.930
Yes to rainbow Code!

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.640
Cheers!

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.440
Awesome!

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:28.640
Fxxk you, the Travel Code!

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:49.290
Fxxk you, the Travel Code!

00:37:52.370 --> 00:38:00.660
Fxxk your uncle!

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.330
People used curse words to express their anger.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.200
The blocked and censored voices of the Internet were totally unleashed.

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.530
Are they serving the people?

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.100
No!

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.490
Are they serving the people?

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.820
No!

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.190
Are they serving the people?

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:30.620
Assholes! Assholes! Assholes!

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.480
Amidst a chorus of curses, 

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.890
people let go of their emotional burdens,

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.200
the protest slogans become diverse and lively.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:47.390
A single spark can start a prairie fire.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.730
We demand art, not censorship!

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.410
Nothing is unnecessary.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.750
No Model Operas!

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.380
No Model Operas!

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.320
Freedom of Movie!

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.950
No wolf warriors! No censorship!

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:17.420
Return Liu Xiaobo to us!

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.420
Don't aid the tyrant.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.950
Return our human rights!

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:24.000
Return our arts! Return our human rights!

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.630
Return our arts! Return our human rights!

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.980
Return my youth!

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:31.980
Return my youth!

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.940
Emancipate the mind, and seek truth from facts.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.710
Each slogan echoed

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.140
the profound impact of the CCP's authoritarian politics 

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.270
on the ordinary people of China.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.880
This might be the first time in their lives for many Chinese people 

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.710
to express their political opinions and demands in public.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.680
Open the country's gates!

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.940
Apologize, for those who couldn't make it to today

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:19.450
We demand apologies!

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.930
No daily reports.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.580
No to Xuexi Qiangguo App!

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.570
There is nothing wrong with young people enjoying their holidays.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.330
There is nothing wrong with young people enjoying their holidays.

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:45.440
A debt of blood must be paid in blood!

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.330
Publicize the death toll, 

00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:52.720
do not conceal it, and do not deceive the people.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:41:15.020
Freedom of speech!

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:30.000
Freedom of the press!

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.600
We are human beings, not cows and sheep!

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.770
We are human beings!

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.010
We are human beings, we have our dignity.

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:46.020
We demand dignity!

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.850
The spirit of the May 4th Movement! The spirit of the June 4th Movement!

00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:03.510
Rehabilitate the participants of June 4th!

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:10.110
Apologize to Mr. Hu Yaobang!

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.370
How to address the current issues in China? 

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.120
Whom to hold accountable? 

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.540
Everyone knows it deep down in their hearts.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.080
Chinese nation is now facing its greatest danger.

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:29.950
Who restricted our freedom?

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:32.420
Xi Jinping!

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.690
Remove the dictator and national traitor Xi Jinping!

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.890
Years of grievances, 

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.020
suffering of unreasonableness, unlawfulness, and injustice,

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.110
were being vented out at this moment.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:00.110
We don't want Xi Jinping!

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.980
We don't want Xi Jinping!

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.760
Awesome! Awesome!

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:15.620
We demand freedom!

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.620
Maybe this gathering at this night

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.970
was destined to be stigmatized and erased from Chinese Internet, 

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:25.880
leaving only a void. 

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.600
However, it is precisely this situation that 

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.660
strengthens the determination of the participants.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.790
The atmosphere also reached a climax

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:48.210
We demand freedom! We demand freedom!

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:52.180
We don't want the CCP!

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.060
Hey, you can't say this.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.550
We can.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.600
Possibly due to prolonged political suppression, 

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.450
people remained cautious when it comes to free expression.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.050
Referendum!

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:09.000
There are nationwide PCR tests, there can be a referendum.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.450
Down with Xitler!

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.890
No dictatorship but reform!

00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.060
No dictatorship but democracy!

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:25.060
No dictatorship but democracy!

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:45.490
Xi Jinping, step down!

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:58.150
Abolish the re-election! Xi Jinping, step down!

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.800
Step down! Step down!

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.300
Amidst anger, people also felt confused briefly,

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.800
After the catharsis, how to effectively resist authoritarianism, 

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.680
advocate for demands, 

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.330
and protect their rights?

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.360
Many deficiencies were revealed.

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.440
But we cannot criticize such a spontaneously formed gathering.

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.410
In the past of China,

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.320
even among friends, 

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.220
politics had been a taboo topic to talk about. 

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:30.370
But here, every stranger could have faith in each other,

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.200
and fight against this numb and apathetic political environment together.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.840
This was enough.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.520
CCP step down!

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.510
No cultural revolution but reform!

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.990
Don't be a slave, be a citizen!

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.990
Lift the lockdown in Xinjiang!

00:45:55.990 --> 00:46:05.990
Lift the lockdown across whole China!

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.770
All power in the PRC belongs to the people.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.910
Who lies to Chinese people, is asshole.

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:13.910
Good point.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.640
Shame on the dictator!

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:19.390
We demand to be citizens!

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.980
We demand to be in charge!

00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.530
We demand votes.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.990
We demand votes!

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.970
The cultivation of people's rights awareness requires soil.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:39.010
On the blank papers raised this night, 

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.960
nothing was written, 

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.100
but everyone understood,

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.760
it carried the hope for the future of China.

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:54.330
I want to be a citizen!

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.340
However, before the real dawn of hope arrives, 

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.990
we still need to go through countless dark nights.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:10.780
At 3:20 AM, 

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.710
The police detention vehicles were in position, 

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:14.780
the police began pressuring and dispersing the demonstrators.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.990
The police bus has arrived.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.620
To ensure their own safety, many people chose to leave.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.430
Serve the People now!

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:45.080
Don't beat people! Don't use violence!

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.900
Don't beat people! 

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.960
Don't use violence!

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.930
Don't hit us, we're leaving.

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:03.750
Don't hit people! Don't use violence!

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.740
No touch! No touch!

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.200
The rest of people found themselves encircled by the police, 

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.490
as plainclothes police officers within the crowd initiated chaos.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.920
Who are these two?

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:19.670
I don't know.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.850
Plainclothes police? 

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:25.760
They should be plainclothes police.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.050
Plainclothes, fxxk.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.920
Was that one of yours?

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.760
Back up.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.280
Were the guys pulled people one of yours?

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.370
Were they one of yours?

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:34.470
Are they legal?

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.260
That's it? I'd like to ask you.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:38.430
Step back.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:42.370
Is there any vehicle we can take here, may I ask?

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.160
The guy who pulled people away, are they legal?

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:53.100
There're plainclothes, right?

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.690
It must be plainclothes.

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:56.230
They were pulling people like this.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:57.660
What the fxxk?

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.060
I thought they were stopping people from fighting.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:48:59.910
They were plainclothes, right?

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:02.080
Pulling like that, definitely not...

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.670
A memorial for their deceased compatriots 

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.980
was met with harsh government crackdown. 

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.900
People felt both disappointed and angry.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:22.730
At 4:00 AM, 

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:25.850
the crowd finally faced violent eviction by the police. 

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:28.170
Several protesters were arrested on the spot, 

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.950
and the flowers and candles were forcibly cleared away.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.310
Serve the People!

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.710
Don't fight.

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:51.880
The police are beating people!

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.900
Don't use violence!

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.440
Don't use violence!

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.860
Don't use violence!

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.830
Stop filming! Stop filming!

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.440
Don't use violence!

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:32.130
Don't use violence!

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:36.450
Step back!

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.290
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:39.840
What did he do wrong? Why arrest me?

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.970
What did he do wrong? Why arrest me?

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.070
The people's police take our (tax-paid) salaries, 

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.980
and arrest our own people?

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.680
No one is behaving aggressively.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.000
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.630
Why are you arresting him?

00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.150
Why are all of you standing against the people? 

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.640
Are we people meant to be oppressed, aren't we?

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.550
People's police should serve the people, 

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.990
contribute to the nation,

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:14.410
not stand here, and block our own people here. 

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.770
Serve the People!

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:19.770
Serve the People!

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.570
Serve the People!

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.760
Serve the People!

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.200
Why stand on the opposite side of the people?

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.660
Fxxkin' cops.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:31.690
Why did you take this job?

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.560
Release them!

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.120
Release them!

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.270
Step back!

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:49.750
Release them!

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.670
Step back! Step back!

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.440
Step back! Step back!

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.870
Step back! Step back!

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.330
Release them!

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:23.070
Step back! Step back!

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:31.190
Whom are you arresting? Is that even legal?

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.110
Release them!

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.800
Don't touch.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.340
It's unnecessary.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.600
Release them!

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:28.040
Release them!

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.050
Can I ask what law was broken?

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.600
Isn't it a crime to lock people in their houses?

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.410
Isn't it a crime to keep people from going to the hospital?

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.570
Being indifferent to lives, pointing guns at the people, isn't that a crime?

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.620
Why can't we film?

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.480
Don't beat.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.860
Don't use force! Don't pull!

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.840
Don't run away.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.520
Keep walking. Keep walking.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.430
Keep walking. Keep walking.

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.890
Are you gonna walk or not?

00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.630
Are you gonna walk or not?

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.750
Which law says we're obstructing public duties?

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.220
I don't wanna bother you, you do not bother me.

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:40.000
Someone's been taken.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.340
Walk up.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.070
Who gave them the right to take people away?

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.220
Move forward. All of you.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.600
Melt away, all keep walking.

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.070
Move forward. Move forward. Don't stand there.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:17.110
Melt away, keep walking.

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.710
Then why are you arresting people?

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.540
According to those arrested, 

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.320
due to the large number of people detained, 

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.210
one police station couldn't accommodate them all, 

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:28.720
so, some were being transported in batches to two other police stations.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:34.240
And they were also subjected to police violence on the bus.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.000
The long and arduous night in Shanghai had come to an end, 

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.840
but new resistances were still ongoing.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.180
On Nov. 27, 2022, during the day, 

00:56:56.180 --> 00:57:00.410
people flocked to protest on Urumqi Middle Road.

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:03.000
Release the arrested!

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:07.260
They protested at the police station and Urumqi Middle Road, 

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.190
demanding the release of those arrested by the police.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.260
We need to be brave. 

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.890
Have I committed a crime by holding a flower?

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.250
Have I broken the law?

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.090
No!

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.980
They dare not arrest us!

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:55.400
Don't use force!

00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:04.110
Don't use force!

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.990
Don't use force!

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:09.250
Don't use force!

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.990
Release him.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:18.050
Release him.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:29.710
It's going too far.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.650
Release him.

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:32.100
It's going too far.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.210
Release him.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.400
A group of plainclothes police ruthlessly used violence against people, 

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.480
trampling on the law under the weight of their power.

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.810
Release him.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.850
Why arrest people?

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.540
Release him.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:07.570
Release him.

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.050
What's going on here?

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.660
That looks horrible.

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.510
Chinese government has mobilized a large number of police forces 

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.150
from Shanghai and nearby provinces, 

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:22.420
attempting to quell the situation through high-pressure measures.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.280
Warning from police:

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.950
The current gathering has already affected public transportation order.

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:39.120
Please leave in an orderly manner.

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.120
For those who continue to stay,

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.310
necessary measures will be taken by the police.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.500
Warning from police...

00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:49.060
But the people of Shanghai did not yield,

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.890
they confronted the authoritarian government head-on. 

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.320
against the violence of the government.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.990
Chants echoed continuously, 

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:58.570
persisting until midnight.

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.470
Step away!

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.800
Go, go, go.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.860
Don't push me, I'll leave.

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.700
Then you leave, leave away, leave away.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.690
Leave or not?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.180
Hurry up and leave. You understand? 

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.340
- Don't push me.    - I push you, so what?    - Why do you push people?

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.430
I told her to leave. What's wrong?

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:20.280
Why do you push people?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.070
What do you wanna do?

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.930
Calm down, calm down.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:32.650
Release them. Release them.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.380
Don't beat.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.990
Don't film, don't film. Put it away.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.640
Fxxk you!

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.620
Chinese people do not beat Chinese people.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.930
Release them. Release them.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:28.010
What did I do wrong? Can someone tell me? 

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:31.750
Why? Why?

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:44.220
The arrested filled the police detention bus, 

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.380
but as the bus passed through the crowd, 

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:49.020
applause and cheers erupted.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:49.940
Stay strong!

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.470
Stay strong! Stay strong!

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.440
How could you beat people?

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.490
However, the situation was perilous for news reporters. 

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:20.440
BBC journalist Ed Lawrence was beaten and arrested by the police.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.770
Why are you arresting people?

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:32.580
Is he Chinese? Is he Chinese? Is he Chinese?

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.500
One man trying to pull away the police 

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.360
was also arrested.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:51.920
Release them! Release them!

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.040
Ed Lawrence was detained by the police for several hours 

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.130
before being released.

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.080
At the subsequent Chinese foreign ministry press conference, 

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.040
facing the inquiries from the British Embassy and BBC, 

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.040
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian 

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.550
denied the violent actions by the Chinese police.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.560
The gathering included a BBC correspondent in Shanghai.

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.110
This BBC correspondent

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.760
refused to cooperate during law enforcement by the police, 

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:36.570
yet pretended to be a victim. 

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:41.970
However, BBC immediately distorted the facts, 

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:44.900
extensively hyping up: 

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:52.040
BBC journalist was arrested and beaten by Chinese police,

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.270
aiming to smear China.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:05:00.490
The CCP government once again blamed it on foreign forces.

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:02.190
(He) should not engage in 

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.250
activities inconsistent with his profession as a journalist. 

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:10.630
This applies to any media outlet, 

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:16.090
and has nothing to do with the so-called freedom of the press.

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:19.730
In China, there are many foreign media outlets; 

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:24.230
why is it always BBC that getting involved in issues? 

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:27.720
This is the question that should be seriously pondered.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:30.220
But even without the BBC coverage, 

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.650
the vulnerabilities of this authoritarian government were exposed.

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:35.050
 Amidst a lockdown in Beijing, 

01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:37.040
residents spontaneously gathered at Liangma Bridge, 

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.810
raising blank papers in solidarity with Shanghai. 

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:42.550
Passing cars honked in support of them, 

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:46.810
and the blank papers became an unspoken sign among the people.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.220
Is there anything written on our blank papers? 

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.770
No. 

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:54.490
All the accusations are in our hearts.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.450
All the mourning is in our hearts.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:06:00.470
Stay strong, Shanghai! 

01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:03.610
Release the arrested, Shanghai!

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.890
Stay strong, Shanghai! 

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.520
Release the arrested, Shanghai!

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.620
NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:15.760
NO to PCR tests, YES to freedom!

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:19.530
We demand freedom!

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:22.010
Officials were urgently present to coordinate

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:24.270
and all they got was a chorus of boos from the crowd.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:26.310
First, this could easily cause the spread of the epidemic

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:32.010
Second, the crowd would cause a stampede, right?

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:34.130
But what about the PCR test crowd, they are bigger than this?

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.810
That issue. That's a different issue.

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:43.330
Now we're talking about this issue today.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:45.790
Everyone, don't be misled by someone.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:48.560
We're not. It's spontaneous.

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.780
The CCP again used its well-known tactic 

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.630
to instigate internal conflicts among the masses, 

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:58.240
but this time no one fell for it.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:04.500
Now there are foreign forces stirring up trouble among our people. 

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.160
There're fxxking none.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:12.050
We're all Chinese.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:19.950
Are the foreign forces you're talking about Marx and Engels?

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.720
Do you mean Marx and Engels? 

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.950
Do you mean Stalin? Do you mean Lenin?

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:29.100
I've always loved our country.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.010
I also think there's something wrong with the current policy.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.680
Don't dance around the topic.

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.360
Was the fire in Xinjiang set by foreign forces?

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.200
No.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:51.500
Was the bus accident in Guizhou caused by foreign forces?

01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:56.480
Everybody, tell me, did foreign forces call us here?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:57.800
No!

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.780
We can't even access foreign websites. 

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.540
Where would these foreign forces come from? 

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:06.000
How could they contact us?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.630
It's only the internal forces that won't let us gather.

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:15.370
Currently, can we go abroad, or can we access the foreign Internet?

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.160
Neither!

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:22.670
How could they contact us? Where were the foreign forces coming from?

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:23.810
From the moon?

01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:27.160
But we demand democracy, we demand freedom.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.370
Long live the democratic CCP!

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.360
Is there a contradiction between democracy, freedom, and the CCP?

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.890
No!

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.170
Is there a contradiction?

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.600
We need to know,

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.190
Under the KMT,

01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:43.120
The CCP was the vanguard of democracy, and the vanguard of freedom.

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.760
We only demand 

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.110
the CCP that once embraced democracy, freedom, and openness to return.

01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:50.110
Just this.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:56.380
Support for the protests in Shanghai and China grew worldwide.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:00.880
Xi Jinping, step down! CCP step down!

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.450
Without the CCP, there would be a new China.

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:09.250
Remove the national traitor Xi Jinping!

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.890
Stay strong, Chinese!

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:19.870
Xi Jinping, step down!

01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:25.130
Xi Jinping, step down!

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.790
CCP step down!

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.380
Down with Xi Jinping!

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:44.470
Communism, step down!

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.050
We stand with Uyghurs, 

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:49.210
we stand with Tibetans, 

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:51.170
we stand with Hongkongers,

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:53.590
we stand with Taiwanese.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.740
Stand with Chinese compatriots.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.170
People across various colleges and cities in China

01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:04.210
also raised blank papers, 

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:06.650
bravely confronting authoritarianism.

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:12.490
From now on, no more blowjobs for the public authority.

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.250
Now, Longquan District is still locked down,

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.280
Qingbaijiang District is still locked down,

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.840
You don't care.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:22.750
Because you've been all paid, from the people's money.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:25.340
The people's money, their savings, have been feeding you.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:27.890
Do you know that? what you are?

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.600
You're parasites.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:36.050
And you're gonna bite us, you're gonna eat us, you're gonna skin us.

01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:38.840
drink our blood and eat our flesh, aren't you?

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.060
Why did you kick out our flowers?

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.570
Why?

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:50.220
Are those flowers guilty? Is it guilty to mourn our own people?

01:10:50.340 --> 01:11:03.060
Give me liberty, or give me death!

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:14.830
Freedom of speech! Freedom of the press!

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.020
The wave of justice prevails over evil, 

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.130
reminding people that authority is not invincible, 

01:11:30.130 --> 01:11:34.600
and true freedom is only achieved through the people's struggle.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.570
Facing the protests from the Chinese people 

01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:09.810
against the "zero-COVID" policy, 

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:13.350
Zhao Lijian, the loyal spokesperson of the CCP, 

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:16.500
for the first time, remained silent for over a minute on the stage.

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.690
And until the very end, 

01:13:11.690 --> 01:13:15.480
they hadn't provided any direct response to the people.

01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:50.480
Some asked, what's the point of taking to the streets to protest?

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.330
In the end, it'd still lead to repression, censorship, and misrepresentation. 

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.480
However, as Churchill said, 

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.680
Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities, 

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.420
because it is the quality which guarantees all others.

01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:10.360
We lacked experience, and were once wavering in cowardice, 

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.900
but today we have the courage to stand up and speak out. 

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.600
What we lacked this time, we will do better next time, 

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:20.420
If given another chance, 

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.690
I would still choose to be on the scene. 

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:26.530
Because a government that fears even blank papers,

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:30.110
cannot crush the justice in the hearts of the people.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:01.810
Involving security and school epidemic prevention and control work,

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.470
 further optimization requirements have been proposed.

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.840
These 10 measures,

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:07.940
are aimed at continuously improving 

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.240
the scientific accuracy of prevention and control.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.890
In implementation, we must resolutely correct

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:15.450
 oversimplification and one-size-fits-all approaches,

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:17.990
avoiding incremental intensification.
