title: 本站极有可能不受 UK GDPR 或 DPA 2018 的约束
---

来自英国[Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/)的[Business Advice Livechat](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-for-small-organisations/contact-us-sme/)支持人员认为，本站“不太可能受到 UK GDPR 或 DPA 2018 的约束”。

特别注意的是，使用`.uk` ccTLD 与履行 UK GDPR 或 DPA 2018 无必然联系。

[2025/3/25 18:13:49] Sarah: Hello, our experience has shown us that if your question requires an in depth discussion then the helpline is your best option.
Livechat is more suitable for providing less detailed explanations and signposting to the website in order to help you resolve your query.
How can I help?
[2025/3/25 18:15:30] Sunset: I'm a non-UK developer who is hosting a blog with a .uk domain. Do I have to follow the DPA & GDPR UK?
[2025/3/25 18:16:13] Sunset: The blog is not targeting UK or EU readers. Actually, it's written in Chinese.
[2025/3/25 18:17:09] Sarah: Whilst I consider your question, please can you provide a few details about your organisation?

-    Is this the first time you've contacted the ICO ?
-    Have you been able to look at any guidance on our website ?
-    How many employees does your organisation have?
-    What sector or industry do you operate in?
[2025/3/25 18:17:43] Sunset: Yes. Yes. Zero. Only me.
[2025/3/25 18:18:46] Sunset: It's a personal blog, so no industry.
[2025/3/25 18:23:20] Sarah: What is the blog about?
[2025/3/25 18:23:58] Sunset: Myself, programming, life tips. No ADs.
[2025/3/25 18:26:31] Sarah: And you're not based in the UK?
[2025/3/25 18:26:39] Sunset: Yes, I'm not.
[2025/3/25 18:28:02] Sarah: Okay, if you don't have an establishment and you aren't targeting UK customers then it is unlikely you will be caught by the scope of UK GDPR or DPA 2018.
[2025/3/25 18:28:53] Sunset: Just to confirm, there is no necessary connection between UK domain names and having to comply with these regulations?
[2025/3/25 18:30:00] Sarah: No not unless yo're based in the UK
[2025/3/25 18:30:12] Sunset: Thanks. Bye.
